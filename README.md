LabDB
=========================
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/BlueMesa/LabDB.png)](https://travis-ci.org/BlueMesa/LabDB)

LabDB is a laboratory inventory management system created with a strong focus
on labs using *Drosophila* as a model organism. In fact, currently most of
the available functionality is dedicated to fly stock management.

The system goes far beyond simple stock list. In fact it is a fully featured
**vial management** system, where every single vial you keep in your lab  has
its unique identifier and an entry in the database.
