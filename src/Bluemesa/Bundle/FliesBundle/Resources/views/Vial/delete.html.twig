  <h4>Are you sure you want to delete this vial?</h4>
  <p>
    Deleting this vial will also delete all the crosses associated with it,
    together with any subsequent crosses.
    This may result in deletion of vials owned by other users!
  </p>
  <p>
    In general you should <strong>never</strong> delete <strong>any</strong>
    vials from the database, unless you have created them by mistake.
  </p>
  <h4>This operation cannot be undone!</h4>
