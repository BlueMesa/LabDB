  <h4>Are you sure you want to delete this stock?</h4>
  <p>
    Deleting this stock will also delete all the vials associated with it.
    Moreover, all the crosses using these vials will be deleted, together
    with any subsequent crosses. This may result in deletion of vials
    owned by other users!
  </p>
  <p>
    In general you should <strong>never</strong> delete <strong>any</strong>
    stocks from the database, unless you have created them by mistake.
  </p>
  <h4>This operation cannot be undone!</h4>
